    <h3 class="text-center">About this project:</h3>
    <p>This is a gaming app, where the mission is to beat the Alien and move on to beat the boss Mr. Brown. This is an app that uses the "touch" feature to drag the space-ship, The bullets that the space-ship uses are timed and 1 every 2 seconds. As you processed to the boss you can shoot 1 each second. This was a partner project and I worked with Michel. In this project, I had to manage the documentation and that helped me to explore and grow my organization skill, another skill that I obtained was speaking clearly. In any project that you have to work with someone you have to be clear on your view of the project and where you wanna take it, if not clear than your partner will not understand you that's where we had a challenge. I had an idea where the user could decide to make it easy or difficult once entering the boss fight. This was a challenge since we had a limit on our skills and time, we also disagree that the user had a lot of control already and adding this feature would only give us more work in too little time which we both agree on.</p>
