            <p>My name is Diego, and welcome to my webpage!! I am a freshman here at Dublin high trying to figure out what do I wanna do, should I be a full-time runner, be a chef, or a programmer. I was introduced to coding over the summer and like any other teenager during summer, they are bored. This add on YouTube popped up and talked about the things you could do if you knew how to program, the keyword for me was “<strong>IF</strong>” because I didn’t know how to program or ever thought of doing something else in my laptop then just play Minecraft. My skills at this time would be a Varsity runner and student, do a little bit of cooking and love music, I got into the guitar just recently and looking to extend my music knowledge of instruments and production. Later on, I developed a passion for it but was getting in the way of soccer and friends, so I stopped and enjoyed my summer with friends. Then Dublin high offered an elective for computer science and I got so happy that I had found the 2 things that will make my high school experience more fun, Cross country/ Track, and Computer science. Thought It would be a good idea but turned out that Cross country was hard and was pushing me to my limits, CSP pushed me to manage my time, to learn that having the best grades and being the star of the track, was not going to happen and that was my reality, thanks, Mr. Brown. throughout my first year in high school, I ran into more obstacles than I would have thought, As I mentioned Xc and track pushed me to the limits and Computer Science also did with my time management. I lost a very good friend named Javier and that put me in a place where I was sad one day angry the other day. Talking to people about made me realize that opening up to not only people but also things is important because as long as we live we are going to encounter obstacles and if we don't open to ask for help or try different things we may never get passed them. When I started to open up I saw that it was easier for me to talk about my problems and people kept telling me that there is no telling when this is going to end but I'm glad I am not alone. Having this obstacle made me realize that I want to keep learning about computers and software and coding I don't know what area of computer science will work for me but I am willing to take the time and effort to get there. I had tons of fun with this project and learned a lot, looking at my future I want to learn more and more about coding. Due to the virus, my freshman activities ended and it is kind of a shame I know that next year will have even more fun in high school, overcome challenges and remember to stay open.    </p>
